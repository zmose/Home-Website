    <h2>Season's Greetings</h2>
    <h4>December 29, 2018</h4>

<br><br><br><br>

    <div id="blogbody">
      <p>It's been a little less than a week since my first post, and I've thought a lot about what I want to do for this project.
      Do I want to keep it a weekly occurrance? Do I want to make these entries longer? Shorter? I feel like a lot of these questions
      are those that can be answered with time, but so far, it's more been a process of planning. I've decided that I want to follow a
      fairly simple formula if I were to keep these weekly. Hopefully by the end of the semester, I have perfected whatever formula I decide
      to settle on. </p>

      <p>First, I talk about what I did for the previous week in terms of projects.
      Next, I want to talk about what I would like to do the following week. I don't want to stay on a project for too long, so I would
      like to start a new project at least every month, or 4 blog entries. Finally, I will talk about some other ... thing ... that I
      did during the week that oriented me in the right direction in the field. This can include job applications, student fairs, club
      meetings for <a href="http://acm.psu.edu/">ACM</a>, really anything. This formula is subject to change of course.</p>

      <h5>So, whatcha do this week?</h5>

      <p>Well... Not much. But let me explain! Right off the bat I was dealt a pretty bad hand this week. It's the holidays of course,
      and I didn't really have time to sit in front of a computer and work on my craft on a few days this week. The 24th and 25th were
      hit probably the hardest this week. I think I was able to get in front of a computer for about an hour on Christmas Eve to get a
      bit of work done. I did the bulk of what I wanted to do on December 26th and 27th, with a little more today, the 29th. All in all,
      I could have done better, but I most certainly could have done worse. </p>

      <p>There were two little projects that I wanted to do this week. The first was simply improving the website. I learned a bit more
      as to what Bootstrap 4 is capable of, and I was able to learn a bit about FlexBox. I added an <a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a> for the blogs, I added
      "Previous Blog" and "Next Blog" buttons on the page down below. Right now the end cases either redirect to the Appendix page,
      or they simply go back to the most recent blog. I also worked on how the homepage looked, especially on mobile. Right now I'm
      fairly satisfied with how it looks, but I am somewhat not yet sold on the gray background color. </p>

      <p>The more excited project that I have been working on is a <a href="https://github.com/zmose/CalculatorJava">calculator project</a>
      developed in Java. I am doing this project for a few reasons: the first is to have a better understanding of Java's GUI features,
      specifically the Swing toolkit. I feel like I already have a pretty basic understanding of how to implement basic GUI functionality.
      This however, should put it over the top, especially when I'm using the GridBagLayout layout manager. The second reason is
      to have a stronger grasp on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a> pattern. This project should help me learn how to set up and operate
      this model. Unfortunately right now, I've only had time for the "View" architecture, which is primarily dedicated to learning
      Swing. However, once I nail this, I feel as though the Controller should write itself and the model, the brain of the pattern,
      will be the fun part. Finally, I don't really have a large project that I can show off during interviews. This should fix that. </p>

      <h5>What are you doing next week?</h5>

      <p>I'm going to be away from Dec 30th to Jan 2nd unfortunately. Sorry about that. This will be another week of a lack of development.
      The next blog will (hopefully) be out on January 6th, so I have a solid 4 days to work on the calculator project. Until then, have a
      very happy new year. I don't plan on starting a new project once I get back from my mini vacation, so the calculator project will
      be mine for the taking. </p>

      <h5>What extracurricular activities did you do this week?</h5>

      <p>Right now school is out, so there are no club meeting occurring. I am in the process of applying to summer internships. Unfortunately,
      it's a bit of a drag. But that's the process. I consistently hear nothing from companies that I apply to, which personally I'm more offended by
      than a "no" email. I know it's the holidays and nobody is really checking applications, but I would love to be at least notified if
      I'm not qualified for the job. </p>

      <p>Alas, the search continues. I hope to hear from more companies over the next couple weeks. Until then, I have to keep my head down,
      work on my craft, and hope that I'm good enough to be hired. </p>

      <p>Thanks -- Zack</p>

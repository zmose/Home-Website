    <h2>Zack's no good, awful, unproductive two weeks</h2>
    <h4>January 13th, 2019</h4>

<br><br><br><br>

    <div id="blogbody">
      <p>... Well, it only took 3 weeks, but I did it. I had an entire two weeks with
       essentially no progress towards my projects and my goals. What the
        hell happened? I can explain...</p>

        <h5>Where were you last week?</h5>

        <p>I was, uh, busy. As I mentioned before in my previous post,
           I was away on my little mini vacation, away from laptops and
          testing environments and text editors. I came back from my
         vacation on Wednesday, January 2nd. The 2nd was a wash, I
      wasn't really able to do anything. And after that, the 3rd,
         4th, and 5th... well... the motivation was simply not
          there. So instead of showing my shame and creating a
           blog post on the 6th, I decided to hide and cower.
            For another week. The only excuse I really have for
             not doing ANYTHING from the 7th to the 12th is just
              the fact that I was getting acclimated to my classes
               during syllabus week. Which is a poor excuse, because if you can't
               get any work done during the easiest week of the year, how can you
               expect to get any work done for the rest of the semester. In short,
               this project (all projects, for that matter), were put on hold. </p>

      <p>I actually talked to a friend of mine about this blog project during that time, and he suggested moving away from Github-Pages and instead hosting on a WordPress server (which 99% is really hosted by BlueHost, good stuff by them). So I did a little bit of research, and... no. No, no, no. First of all, I'm concerned about <a href="https://www.ceos3c.com/hacking/how-to-hack-a-wordpress-website/">security issues</a>. Even though I wouldn't really know how to avoid the pitfalls of a securing a public server hosted God knows where, I feel as though I don't have full control of optimizing my site to what I want. Plus in the few <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/migrate-existing-website-to-wordpress/">"how to migrate a static website to a WordPress CMS"</a>   tutorials I've seen, I don't think that's the route that I want to take. </p>

      <p>And why migrate? To make it easier? To not have Atom explode my CPU every time it opens because it thinks that blog posts are actually articulate lines of code? (I need to make the transition to VSCode anyway soon due to Atom's disappointing performance issues in 2018. But I have like 40 packages, 30 of which I probably take for granted during my daily use of the text editor. Why can't I have anything nice?) No.</p>

      <p>So, I'm gonna make my own damn Content Management System. I'm gonna migrate my static pages to a Raspberry Pi 3 under by bunk bed in my dorm that's connected to the school's ethernet, I'll rock the LAMP stack (Linux - the OS, Apache2 - the HTTP server 'software', MySQL - Oracle's way of how to organize 'things' in a DB, PHP - the server side language) on it, I'll brush up on my PHP, and I'll go from there. There's a bit of a 'caveman discovering fire' vibe here, where I know I'm up to something that'll be good for my future, but I really don't know what I'm doing or how to go around maximizing the use of the project. But, unlike the neanderthals of my past, I have Google, so the project shouldn't take thousands of years of evolution to bear the fruits of success. </p>

      <h5>Relax... what stuff have you done beyond the text editor?</h5>

      <p>Well, I applied to a few things, and I was offered a few things. Being a sophomore looking for an internship is pretty tough. I have the experience, I have the pedigree, and I have the drive (just don't look at my last 2 weeks of productivity), but nobody wants me because I'm not a junior. I can think of 20 companies that I met with at job fairs in which the recruiter took my resume and didn't make it past the 4th line and said "Graduating in 2021? Sorry, we're looking for juniors". I feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tav3bI4M6I">Anakin</a> when he gets denied the rank of Jedi Master. 'It's outrageous, it's unfair'. </p>

      <p>Okay, no more complaining, you're right. I shouldn't complain when I'm given the opportunity to attend a great University, doing the thing I love the most, and get the chance to work with the brilliant minds of tomorrow, blah blah blah. But isn't the whole point of a personal blog to bitch and moan? Some blogs talk about the weather, some talk about politics, some talk about how their name was misspelled on plastic Starbucks coffee mugs. Me? I choose to complain about the opportunities that I don't get, rather than focusing on the opportunities that I have been given.</p>

      <p>Oh! Speaking of opportunities that I have been given, I've been given an opportunity! A group of students have given the opportunity to work on a startup with <a href="http://acm.psu.edu/?p=devpsu">DevPSU</a> ! I can't say too much about the subject, but right now it looks like it'll help future students pick a roommate. So, that's great! I can't wait to finally work with a group. It feels like all I do are projects by myself, but to get the chance to work with other people and see how they tick is truly fascinating. </p>

      <p>So, I think that's it for now. I hope my productivity is a little better this week. I have a feeling this will be a good week. </p>


      <p>Thanks -- Zack</p>

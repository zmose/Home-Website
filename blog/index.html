    <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
    <h4>December 23, 2018</h4>

    <div id="blogbody">
      <p>Hello! My name is Zack Mosenson, and welcome to my blog. Today is Sunday, December 23, 2018. The holiday season is in full effect
      and I am currently working in my basement starting a New Years Resolution 8 days early. "What Resolution?", you ask? Well, for a
      while now, I have been meaning to start a blog to document what I have done and how I have learned it. Next year, 2019, will be the
      year that I finally showcase my skills.</p>


      <h5>What's this site made of?</h5>

      <p>This blog project will take place on ZackMosenson.com. The site itself is actually a redirection of <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github Pages</a>, a fantastic tool
      created by Github. The tool allows a user to create a static website. The downside of using Github Pages is that I am unable to use a backend
      to this site. This means that everything you see is here in HTML, CSS, JS, or some other JavaScript library. There are no servers, databases, no PHP to
      serve those nonexistent databases, no SQL (not 'NoSQL', just no SQL) to query those databases' tables for information -- nothing. Everything is here. Which is fine with me. Maybe in the future I will move this site from Github pages to implement
      some type of user fields to allow comments on each of my blogposts. But for now, things will remain simple and remain a <a href="https://github.com/zmose/zmose.github.io" target="_blank">repo on Github</a>, because there is no need to make them complex yet.</p>

      <p>As you can see from the style of each of the pages, the entirety of this website relies on <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">BootStrap 4</a>, the most popular CSS framework. This is simply because
      I love the way it looks. The style, the text, the organization of the navbar... it's beautiful. However, this does not mean that the CSS for each blog will
      follow the same format. In fact, I would love to make it a point to make every page LOOK different in some way, whether the text is different, whether or
      not there are borders around the content of the blog, anything. I just want something that looks good, different, and unique for each entry. </p>


      <h5>So, what's the point?</h5>

      <p>The main objective for this project is simply to showcase what I have learned. It was suggested to me to create some type of blog
      to showcase what I have done. I thought it was a great idea, and I would love to show off who I am and how I become my future self.
      Another reason as to why I am doing this is to continue to motivate myself to be better. A lot of times during the semester, I find myself
      with a lack of motivation to complete some coding project by myself, and instead opt to simply listen and follow along in class rather than
      using the skills I learned in that specific class. </p>

      <p>Not anymore.</p>

      <p>Hopefully a blog will continue to push my urge to learn and my urge to show off what I learn. Everything that I do and share on my blog
      will be posted on <a href="https://github.com/zmose" target="_blank">my Github page.</a> </p>


      <h5>What's next?</h5>

      <p>Thank you very much for reading the first of hopefully many blog entries. I believe this is the start of something new. </p>

      <p>I would love to make this a weekly occurrance, but sometimes it's hard to show off a cool project after only a week of work. Also,
      much like next week, I am busy. So instead of a blog post next week, I hope that everyone has a very Merry Christmas and a Happy Holiday over
      winter break. </p>

      <p>Thanks -- Zack</p>

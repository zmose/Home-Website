    <h2>Hop, Skip, and a Jump into the Semester</h2>
    <h4>January 20th, 2019</h4>

<br><br><br><br>

    <div id="blogbody">
      <p>What an interesting week, to say the least. There are lots of projects that I was able to
      work on with others. This has been quite interesting. </p>

      <h5>What's new this week?</h5>

      <p>Well this week started with Sunday's DevPSU Startup meeting. I was finally able to meet my group,
      get to know each other, learn about our strengths and weaknesses, and get started on the project.
      Right now, we're still in the planning phase of the project, but it looks to be like a lot of fun. We
      are going to be working on a project towards the <a href = "https://www.nittanyai.psu.edu/challenge">Nittany
      AI challenge</a>, a 12-week project that includes developing a project that may be used by the University
      that uses some form of artificial intelligence. </p>

    <p>To prepare for this, I'm actually reading <a href = "https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python">
      Francois Chollet's <i>Deep Learning with Python</i></a>, a rather light book that primarily focuses on
      Tensorflow's <a href = "https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras"> Keras</a> API. It's also helping me learn
      more and more about deep learning that I would have never learned before. This book is really allowing
      me build confidence to be able to compete in the Nittany AI challenge. I really meant to learn some
      form of machine learning, and I'm glad I can work with the big boys and develop intricate neural networks
      necessary for our DevPSU project. </p>

      <p>If you read last week's blog, you know that I was actually looking to create some type of CMS and push
        this website that you are reading away from Github-Pages and to my <a href = "https://www.raspberrypi.org/">
        Raspberry Pi 3</a> so that I could both organize my blogs and have readers create profiles. Well,
        we ran into a couple of snags. The first being that it's actually not allowed.
      </p>

      <p>It all started on Thursday. I spent pretty much most of the week either reading <i>Deep Learning</i>
      or re-teaching myself PHP and how to use it in conjunction with MySQL. It didn't occur to me that the
      process of running an Apache Server on a Raspberry Pi over Penn State's ethernet was more complicated
      than I thought. I usually just worked in my dorm and tinkered with PHP from my dorm on a local server.
      No one could access it unless they were on the Penn State Wi-Fi. I didn't realize this was a problem
      until I attempted to SSH into the Pi from Willard, a half mile from my dorm.
      </p>

      <p> And that's where I learned that I probably wasn't going to be able to move this site to my own server.
      Turns out that you need a few things to be able to do so. First, you need a static external IP address to
      access the server outside the local network. You can only obtain these by asking your Internet Service
      Provider. Obviously, I don't have contact with Penn State's ISP, and I seriously doubt that even if I did,
      I would be allowed to run a web server out of my dorm room. Second, I would need to keep the Pi plugged in,
      forever, and pray that the power NEVER goes out. This is because Penn State somewhat scrambles IP addresses
      like a VPN. Power goes out, lose the static external IP address. At least that's my theory. </p>

      <p> Another solution is to make a carbon copy of the site and put it on my <a href = "https://sites.psu.edu/zackmosenson/">
      Penn State site that I never use.</a> But the worst part? It's powered by Wordpress. So, I could have that
      redirect to my domain name, but I'm just not sure that I want to attempt to copy and paste files all day.
      This definitely seems like a last resort plan. But hey, if this ain't broke, I won't fix it.</p>

      <h5> So what are you doing this week?</h5>

      <p> Tonight, I'm going to another DevPSU meeting. I also meet with my group on Thursdays, so that's very exciting.
      I'm glad that the project is finally getting off the ground. The DevPSU guys are really great. I really don't
      think I've worked on too many 'group projects', so this would be a breath of fresh air in terms of work flow.
      We're actually using <a href = "https://trello.com">Trello</a> to manage our work flow. Things look great so far.
      </p>

      <p> Other than that, I'm just going to keep reading my book. I'm not too too far into it, but I am enjoying it.
      What can I say? It's the middle of the semester. I'm here to go to school. If I come across a project, or if I
      get inspired by something, I'll do it. Until next time. </p>





      <p>Thanks -- Zack</p>
